  <h1> Project 1: Augmented Grafitti </h1>
    <h2> The Process </h2> 
      <h3> Location </h3>
        <p> I decided on the Showalter Fountain, although I was considering an area in Eskenazi. I knew there was quite the history behind it & wanted to explore that more.</p>
    
      <h3> Ideas </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Stolen/Missing Fish </li>
          <li> Birth of Venus (Goddess of Love & Beauty)</li>
        </ul> 
        <h4> I ultimately decided on the Birth of Venus because I am not familiar with the Renaissance period and wanted to know more about the meaning behind it </h4> 
    
      <h3> Research </h3>
        <h5> Beauty Standards during the Renaissance </h5> 
          <h6> "Makeup" <h6>
          <h6> Female vs Male Perspective </h6>
          <h6> Influence from Christianity & Men </h6>
          
      <h3> Design </h3>
      <ol> 
        <li> Collage of Christianity & Misogyny Contradictions on Women's Beauty Standards</li>
      
        <li> Portrait inspired by Simonetta Vespucci (No Makeup vs Makeup) </li> 
      </ol>
